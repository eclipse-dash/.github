# The Eclipse Dash Project

Eclipse Dash is a place where the community itself collaborates on tools for community awareness and collaboration in support of our ultimate objective of committer quality and cooperation.

This is an incubator for committer tools and other resources that could improve the overall Eclipse Foundation community experience.
